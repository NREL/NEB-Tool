    <span class="bold">Key Performance Indicators (KPI)</span> are the critical (key) quantifiable indicators of
    progress toward an intended
    result and are used to track progress towards business objectives.

    Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are the goals to be achieved, while Key Performance Measures (KPMs) are the data
    that measures progress towards those goals. JUSTIFI uses this distinction to help organize KPMs so that non-energy
    benefits are more easily found and aligned with business objectives.
