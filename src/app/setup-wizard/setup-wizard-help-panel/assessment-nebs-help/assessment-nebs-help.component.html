<p>
    If NEBs are found that cannot be associated with a <span class="bold">specific</span> energy efficiency opportunity,
    then they should be added
    here.
</p>
<p>
    This could be used for both non-related NEBs found in facility walkthroughs and NEBs requiring the implementation of
    multiple energy efficiency opportunities. e.g. Implementing several opportunities results in being able to turn off
    equipment or meet a secondary goal.

    Non-Energy Benefits can be added to assessment with the "<fa-icon [icon]="faPlus"></fa-icon> Add NEB" button.
</p>
<p>
    Clicking this button will give you two options for adding a new NEB:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        "<fa-icon [icon]="faPlus"></fa-icon> Add Custom NEB" will add a free form Non-Energy Benefit to the assessment
        where the user can name the NEB and enter a direct financial impact in &dollar;/yr.
    </li>
    <li>
        "<fa-icon [icon]="faSearchPlus"></fa-icon> Search NEBs Database" will open a modal with a list of all the
        Non-Energy Benefits that are currently in the
        tool.
    </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>
    Once a NEB is entered, <span class="bold">"Key Performance Metric Impacts"</span> can be added. These are impacts
    that
    the NEB has on
    performance metrics the company is tracking.
</p>
<p>
    The "<fa-icon [icon]="faSearchPlus"></fa-icon> Search Key Performance Metrics" button will open a modal with a list
    of
    all performance metrics in the tool. If a metric is known to be typically associated with the NEB, it will be
    identified with an <fa-icon [icon]="faAsterisk"></fa-icon>.
</p>
<p>
    Details about the performance metric and the impact the associated NEB will have can then be entered on the screen.
</p>

<p>
    A list of NEBs found to be associated with specific energy efficiency opportunities is provided at the bottom of the
    screen.
